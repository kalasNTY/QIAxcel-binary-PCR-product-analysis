\title{
QIAxcel binary PCR product analysis
}
\description{
This function imports csv data tables from "QIAxcel screen gel" software, retrieves the concentrations of two amplification products of defined lengths and outputs the ratio of their concentrations as longproduct/(longproduct+shortproduct). The wells to be analyzed have to be passed as vector argument. Optionally the margin of product length retrieval can be changed. Furthermore, the repl argument (replicates) accepts values 1,2 and 3 for sample replicates sequentially present in the wells to be analyzed. If duplicates or triplicates are analyzed qcell outputs the average and standard deviation for the n samples.
}
\usage{
qcell(file, x, y, z, margin = 6, repl = 1, round = 4)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{file}{
the name of the csv file which the data are to be read from. The csv file has to be generated using "QIAxcel ScreenGel" software as a standard data export. The experiment file name generated by this software ("n_Ex.csv") is to be used as input.
}
\item{x}{
character vector. Containing the names of the wells to be analyzed. Alternatively, "all" or "rowN" or "columnN" can be inputted.
}
\item{y}{
numeric. The length (in bp) of the shorter amplification product to be analyzed. 
}
\item{z}{
numeric. The length (in bp) of the longer amplification product to be analyzed. 
}
\item{margin}{
numeric. The margin (in bp) can be changed (default margin=6). The value is used to find the desired amplification products with a defined margin.
}
\item{repl}{
numeric. The number of replicates used in the experiment can be changed (default repl = 1) in order to obtain the average and standard deviation for n = 2 or n = 3 replicates 
} 
\item{round}{
numeric. The number of digits that the outputted results should be rounded to. Default = 4 digits
}

\value{
The value outputted using repl = 1 (default) is a data: n observables of 2 variables (well name and product ratio). For repl = 2 or repl = 3 the output value is a data frame defined by n observables (replicated samples) of 2 variables (average and standard deviation).
